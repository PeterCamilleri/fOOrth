# The Documentation Folder.

This folder contains the User Guide and example snippets used in that guide.
The user guide is prepared using the Apache OpenOffice 4 OpenOffice Writer
program.

In parallel with the .odt files, .pdf files will be released. These will be for
version 0.0.3 (because it is the first file to be released) and on every new
minor (x.N+1.0) release.

This is needed as git does not "understand" either the .odt or .pdf file formats.
