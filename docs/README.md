# The Documentation Folder.

This folder contains the User Guide and example snippets used in that guide.
The user guide is prepared using the Apache OpenOffice 4 OpenOffice Writer
program.

As various versions of the guide are released, pdf versions of each release will
be added to the archive. This is needed as git does not "understand" either the
odt or pdf file formats.
